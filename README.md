# South African Crime Analysis

This project explores crime trends in South Africa using SAPS crime stats and Stats SAâ€™s General Household Survey data.  
It identifies **crime hotspots**, predicts **future crime patterns**, and links them to **socio-economic factors**.  

I used:
- **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** for classification (both reached 100% accuracy)
- **Time series forecasting** to predict future crime trends
- A **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize crime by year, province, and category
